In:Sanity<br>
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
We have created a game in which the main character is suffering from heavy migraines and a haunting, combining to lead their mind to act up, projecting its own monsters out into the physical world, the inside of their mind being launched out.

## Game Play
Escape the house by avoiding monsters and solving puzzles. Keep your migraine from returning by taking your medicine, these wear off and send you into your own mindscape where navigation becomes more difficult. Monsters cannot be fought, only scared away by a flashlight. Find keys and items to progress.<br>
Movement is WASD, interaction is E, medicine is P, flashlight is F, dialogue progression is ENTER, and pause menu is ESC

## Impediments
The dialogue boxes didn't implement into the game as smoothly as expected, also Skye left his usb stick at Franklin

## Implementation
Features: inner dialogue, music & sounds, reality-switching feature, multiple levels, raycasting, enemy attacks, manner of stopping enemies without fighting them directly, different objectives in different levels<br>
Software used: Godot, Adobe Photoshop<br>
Font used: Scary Feet
